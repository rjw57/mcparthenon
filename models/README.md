# Parthenon Sculpture 3D Models

3D data for the Parthenon Sculptures are not easy to come by, The University of
Southern California ran [a scanning
project](http://gl.ict.usc.edu/Data/parthenongallery/) in around 2004. They had
some VRML models available which are now only available via [the Wayback
machine](https://web.archive.org/web/20111126213811/http://gl.ict.usc.edu/parthenongallery/galleries.php).

This directory contains copies of the original VRML files.
